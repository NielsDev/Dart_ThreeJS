Dart_ThreeJS
============

This is a library wrapper for ThreeJS in Dart so you can easily use ThreeJS in Dart.
The aim is to be able to use all the functionality ThreeJS provides in Dart.

Using Dart_ThreeJS
------------------

If you want to use Dart_ThreeJS in your Dart application, you need to include the ThreeJS javascript library too.
You can see an example at web/example.dart and web/example.html.
The ThreeJS library is not included and you will need to download it at http://threejs.org/.
The ThreeJS license is also included with this library wrapper.
Please keep in mind that I do not own ThreeJS and it is not my work, this is just a library wrapper!
